				<p class="date" >05/06/2012</p>
				<p>Mathematical analysis, which mathematicians refer to simply as analysis, is a branch of 
				pure mathematics that includes the theories of differentiation, integration and measure, 
				limits, infinite series, and analytic functions. These theories are often studied in the 
				context of real numbers, complex numbers, and real and complex functions. Analysis may be 
				conventionally distinguished from geometry. However, theories of analysis can be applied to 
				any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of nearness (a topological space) or, 
				more specifically, distance (a metric space).</p>
				<p class="h10" ><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">Data structures and algorithms</a></p>
				<p class="date" >07/06/2012</p>
				<p>In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing 
				data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
				Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some 
				are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, B-trees are particularly well-suited 
				for implementation of databases, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to 
				look up identifiers.
				Data structures are used in almost every program or software system. Data structures provide 
				a means to manage huge amounts of data efficiently, such as large databases and internet 
				indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are a key to designing efficient 
				algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, 
				rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design.</p>
				<p class="h10" ><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">Databases</a></p>
				<p class="date" >11/06/2012</p>
				<p>The database concept has evolved since the 1960s to ease increasing difficulties in 
				designing, building, and maintaining complex information systems (typically with many 
				concurrent end-users, and with a large amount of diverse data). It has evolved together 
				with database management systems which enable the effective handling of databases. Though 
				the terms database and DBMS define different entities, they are inseparable: a database's 
				properties are determined by its supporting DBMS and vice-versa. The Oxford English 
				dictionary cites[citation needed] a 1962 technical report as the first to use the term 
				"data-base." With the progress in technology in the areas of processors, computer memory, 
				computer storage and computer networks, the sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases 
				and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitudes.</p>
				<p class="h10" ><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a></p>
				<p class="date" >12/06/2012</p>
				<p>Computer programming (often shortened to programming or coding) is the process of designing, 
				writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source 
				code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to create a 
				set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired 
				behaviors. The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, 
				including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.</p>
				<p class="h10" ><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry">Analytic geometry</a></p>
				<p class="date" >13/06/2012</p>
				<p>Geometric analysis is a mathematical discipline at the interface of differential geometry 
				and differential equations. It includes both the use of geometrical methods in the study of 
				partial differential equations (when it is also known as "geometric PDE"), and the application 
				of the theory of partial differential equations to geometry. It incorporates problems involving 
				curves and surfaces, or domains with curved boundaries, but also the study of Riemannian 
				manifolds in arbitrary dimension.</p>
